## Overview

The dehazing algorithm is designed to enhance the quality of images affected by haze. This method is effective for various applications in image processing where haze reduction is required.

This project implements a single-image haze removal technique using the Dark Channel Prior, as described in the research paper: ``Single Image Haze Removal Using Dark Channel Prior``
